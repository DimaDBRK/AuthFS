# Full Stack Developer Assignment
![Logo](other/Auth.jpg)

This application aims to augment a basic authentication system with advanced features that allow users to create organizations and invite other registered users to join these organizations. 

The app's technology stack comprises:
- Frontend: React and Material UI
- Backend: Flask
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication System: JWT-based

## Description

App prioritizes user experience by providing clear feedback messages and efficient frontend routing through React-Router.

By enhancing the authentication system with these features, the app aims to provide a secure and user-friendly environment for creating and managing organizations, fostering collaboration and efficient user interaction.

## Database

PostgreSQL.
Models ref: backend\app\models.py
There are Tables:

User - includes user information
> class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(1000), nullable=False)

Organization - name and the user who initiated its creation.
> class Organization(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    author_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id', ondelete='CASCADE'), nullable=False)

OrganizationUser - Users who are affiliated with an organization. One User can belong to several organizations.
> class OrganizationUser(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    organization_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('organization.id', ondelete='CASCADE'), nullable=False)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id', ondelete='CASCADE'), nullable=False)

## Backend and API

Flask server.
Models ref: backend\app\routes.py
List of APIâ€™s:
User
* post /signup - register
* post /signin - login
* get /users -  all users info
* post /users/delete-user - delete user (by email)
* get /users/user/<string:email> - get User Info (by email)
* put /users/user/update -  protected, update User Info (by email)


Tokens and Auth
* get /verify - protected route to check token for Auth component in React

Organization management
* post /create-org - create new organization
* deleted /delete-org - delete organization (by name)
* get /organizations - all organizations info
* post //get-org-by-author - PROTECTED, only organizations info created by user = author
* post /add-users-to-org - add user to organization (and check if this user don't belong to this organization)
* post /delete-user-from-org - delete user from organization (by email and organization name)
* get /get-users-by-org - get users = emails for this organization


## Frontend

React frontend:
Material UI is employed to design and structure the application's pages.
Dark and Light themes

Data Visualization: 
Nivo (https://nivo.rocks/) and Recharts (https://recharts.org/) charting libraries have been utilized to achieve a refined and sophisticated appearance for the dashboard.

Filtering of data has been implemented both on the server and in the frontend.

The combination of MUI GridDataGrid and GridToolbar facilitates efficient management of server-side pagination and data export to files.


Users have the capability to save preferences and manage their profiles, encompassing actions such as updating their username, deleting their profile, as well as adding and removing reports (views).

Pages and main components.
![Dashboard](dashboard.jpg)
Side bar includes:
* Dashboard - cards of reports
* My reports - dynamically updated list of user reports
* Settings - Reports management (add and remove from My reports list) and Profile
* Developer settings - additional features

Nav bar:
* Button to open and close Side bar
* Dashboard button
* Switch themes button
* User Name and Role info
* Log out and Profile in additional menu

## Authentication
![Signin](other/Signin.jpg)
Token-based authentication employs two distinct tokens: the access token, stored in cookies with a short lifespan, and the refresh token, stored in both a dedicated database table and local storage, featuring a prolonged lifespan. A dedicated API facilitates token verification and updates upon the validation of the refresh token. JSON Web Token (JWT) serves as the foundation, utilizing JSON to craft access tokens, thereby enabling the utilization of application or API resources.

Furthermore, the implementation of Protected Routes within React Router ensures that authorized access is maintained.

### User Roles and Permissions:
The system delineates between two distinct user roles: User and Developer.
Developers are endowed with specialized access privileges, encompassing features such as Database management on the Developer page, access to a comprehensive users list, and the capability to delete refresh tokens.
On the other hand, users are allocated restricted access, limited solely to the exploration of reports.
This role-based structure ensures a controlled and secure user experience.


## Future Scalability

The application is designed with a modular structure, providing the potential for seamless integration of additional features and data sources in the future.

## Installation
1. .env file for server includes:
- PORT => by server side
- DB_HOST=...
- DB_PORT=...
- DB_USER=...
- DB_NAME=...
- DB_PASS=...
- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=...
- ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=60
- REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=...
- REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=300


2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone REPO NAME
cd yourproject

2. Install the dependencies for the Node.js server:
cd server
npm install

Start the Node.js server:
npm start

3.Install the dependencies for the React frontend:
cd ../client
npm install

Start the React development server:
npm start

4. The Node.js server will run and the React development server will run on http://localhost:3000. You can access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.
